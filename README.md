# Week1HoriseonRefactor

For this assignment I refactored the html and css code for the Horiseon page. In the HTML file unnecesary div tags were replaced with more appropriate semantic tags. This included main tag followed by individual section tags for the three statements in the main body of the page.

An aside tag was used for the content that appears on the right hand side of the page which is not as important.

Respective header and footer tags were used at the beginning and the end of the document.

The div tag containing the navigation links was replaced with a nav tag.

For the css, all elements in the html file tht shared the same css stylings were given one class in order to consolidate html code as well as css code.

This included the main tag, the benefit class, the h3 elements with in the benefit class, the service class, the h2 elements within the service class, as well as respective img tags that contained the same stylings
